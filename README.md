## üì¢ News
- **[2025-06-XX]** We release RM Gallery v0.1.0 now, which is also available in [PyPI](https://pypi.org/simple/rm-gallery/)!
----

## üåü Why RM-Gallery?

RM-Gallery is a one-stop platform for training, building and operationalizing reward models. It provides a comprehensive solution for implementing reward models at both task-level and component-level, with high-throughput and fault-tolerant capabilities.

### Training RM
- **Integrated RM Training Pipeline**: Provides an RL-based framework for training reasoning reward models, compatible with popular frameworks (e.g., verl, OpenRLHF), and offers examples for integrating RM-Gallery into the framework.

### Building RM
- **Unified Reward Model Architecture**: Flexible implementation of reward models through standardized interfaces, supporting various architectures (model-based/free), reward formats (scalar/critique), and scoring patterns (pointwise/listwise/pairwise)

- **Comprehensive RM Gallery**: Provides a rich collection of ready-to-use Reward Model instances for diverse tasks (e.g., math, coding, preference alignment, agent) with both task-level(RMComposition) and component-level(RewardModel). Users can directly apply RMComposition for specific tasks or assemble custom RMComposition via component-level RewardModel.

- **Principle-Critic-Score Paradigm**: Adopts the Principle+Critic+Score-based reasoning Reward Model  paradigm, offering best practices to help users generate principles with limited preference data.

### Operationalizing RM

- **Multiple Usage Scenarios**: Covers multiple Reward Model (RM) usage scenarios with detailed best practices, including Training with Rewards (e.g., post-training), Inference with Rewards (e.g., Best-of-NÔºårefinement)

- **High-Performance RM Serving**: Leverages the New API platform to deliver high-throughput, fault-tolerant reward model serving, enhancing feedback efficiency.



## üì• Installation
> RM Gallery requires **Python 3.10** or higher.


### Install From source

```bash
# Pull the source code from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/modelscope/rm-gallery.git

# Install the package in editable mode
pip install -e .
```

### Install From PyPi

```bash
pip install rm-gallery
```

## üöÄ Quick Start
<strong> üöÄ üöÄ Build RM with one-line code </strong>

```python
#Initialize using the registry pattern
rm = RewardRegistry.get("Your RM's Registry Name")(name="demo_rm")
```
For complete basic usage of RM-Gallery, please refer to [Quick Start](docs/quick_start.ipynb).

## ü§ù Contribute

Contributions are always encouraged!

We highly recommend install pre-commit hooks in this repo before committing pull requests.
These hooks are small house-keeping scripts executed every time you make a git commit,
which will take care of the formatting and linting automatically.
```shell
pip install -e .
pre-commit install
```
