SCENARIO = (
    "Code: Involves generating, understanding, or modifying programming language code within text.",
)
PRINCIPLES = [
    "Technical Accuracy in Implementation: Ensure strict adherence to language-specific syntax, APIs, and platform conventions to avoid logical or runtime errors.",
    "Precise Problem Diagnosis: Identify and resolve root causes rather than applying superficial fixes, prioritizing accurate error localization.",
    "Efficiency Through Built-in Features: Leverage native tools, libraries, or optimizations (e.g., vectorized operations, built-in methods) to minimize redundancy and improve performance.",
    "Clarity in Communication and Structure: Provide step-by-step explanations, well-documented code, and structured outputs to enhance readability and maintainability.",
    "Robustness with Validation and Error Handling: Implement rigorous input validation, edge-case handling, and error recovery mechanisms to ensure reliability under unexpected conditions.",
