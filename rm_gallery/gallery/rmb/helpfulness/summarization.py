PRINCIPLES = [
    "Comprehensive Coverage of Core Content: A superior summary captures all critical elements, themes, and details central to the source material without omitting key information.",
    "Logical Structure and Coherence: Information is organized in a clear, hierarchical, or chronological sequence to ensure readability and logical progression of ideas.",
    "Avoidance of Irrelevant or Tangential Information: Focuses exclusively on the primary subject, eliminating extraneous details that distract from the core narrative or argument.",
    "Synthesis Over Literal Extraction: Prioritizes rephrasing and analytical integration of information (production) rather than verbatim selection (extraction) to enhance clarity and depth.",
    "Preservation of Specific Terminology and Nuance: Retains precise terms, data, and stylistic elements from the source to maintain fidelity and contextual accuracy.",
]

SCENARIO = "Summarization: The text is compressed into a short form, retaining the main information, which is divided into extraction (directly selected from the original text) and production (rewriting the information)."
