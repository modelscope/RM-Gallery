# Ready-to-use Rewards
RM Gallery provides a comprehensive collection of ready-to-use reward models, organized by application scenarios to facilitate easy selection and implementation.
Our reward model collection is continuously expanding.

## 1 Alignment
The Alignment module provides reward models for evaluating and optimizing model outputs according to human values, including safety, helpfulness, and factual accuracy.

**About Reward Model Definitions**
The HHH (Helpfulness, Harmlessness, and Honesty) reward models are defined following the principles and methodology described in [A General Language Assistant as a Laboratory for Alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.00861). The specific HHH scenarios are mostly derived from two major reward model benchmarks: [RewardBench2](https://huggingface.co/spaces/allenai/reward-bench) and [RMB Bench](https://github.com/Zhou-Zoey/RMB-Reward-Model-Benchmark). Our reward model design adopts the Principle-Critic-Score paradigm, where principles are generated by sampling 10% of data from the relevant benchmark scenarios. For detailed settings and comparative results, please refer to the [autoprinciple tutorial](docs/tutorial/autoprinciple.ipynb).
Additionally, some reward models are sourced from external pre-defined implementations, such as [detoxify](https://github.com/unitaryai/detoxify).

### Base Reward Models Overview

| Helpfulness| The assistant aims to provide helpful and informative responses to users, responding to their queries with relevant and accurate information. | base_helpfulness_pointwise/base_helpfulness_listwise | True |
| Harmlessness| The assistant aims to answer questions, avoiding harmful behaviors such as spreading misinformation, spreading harmful ideas, or engaging in other harmful activities. | base_harmlessness_pointwise/base_harmlessness_listwise | True |
| Honesty| The assistant aims to truthfully answer the user's questions with no bias or prejudice. | base_honesty_pointwise/base_honesty_listwise| True |
