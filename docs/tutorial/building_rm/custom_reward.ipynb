The statement doesn't use any discriminatory terms. Principle 3 is factual accuracy. The statement is a general assertion of equality, which is factually accurate in many contexts, though it might depend on the specific framework (like human rights vs. biological equality). Principle 4 is maintaining user privacy, which isn't relevant here.\n",
