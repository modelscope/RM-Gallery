RMB class inheriting from RouterComposition to manage reward model routing configurations for various task types.

Attributes:
    router (Dict[str, dict]): Mapping of task types to corresponding reward classes, supporting multiple NLP task evaluations.
    The dictionary contains:
        - Keys: Task type strings (e.g., "brainstorming", "chat")
        - Values: Dictionaries with "cls" key pointing to specific reward classes
        - Special key "general": Default HelpfulnessPointWiseReward for general cases
